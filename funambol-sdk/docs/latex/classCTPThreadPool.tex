\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class implements a pool of thread to be used by the CTP. 

The purpose is not reusing existing threads, but rather to ensure that thread objects are properly release when no longer running. This class is a very simple form of garbage collection for CTP threads. The cleanup is not performed automatically but must be explicitelly invoked. Since CTP has periodic activity this is not a problem in this context. 



The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{CompactItemize}

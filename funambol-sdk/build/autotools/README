The port of the Funambol C++ Client API to Unix/Linux
was done by Patrick Ohly <patrick.ohly@gmx.de>.
It uses libcurl for HTTP transfer of SyncML messages.

The Sync4j configuration tree is mapped to files
under $HOME/.sync4j/<node>/config.txt where
<node> specifies the path in the tree and "config.txt"
is a simple text file with one
 <property> = <value>
pair per line. Lines starting with (optional) spaces
and a hash (#) are comments and skipped. <property>
is case insensitive. <value> is everything following
the equal sign and the (optional) spaces after it
until the end of the line. Values starting with spaces
or containing newlines are not supported.

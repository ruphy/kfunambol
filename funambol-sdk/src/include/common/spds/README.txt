 * @defgroup SyncEngine Sync Engine
 *
 * The "common/spds" directory contains the core implementation of the
 * SyncML protocol for item synchronization together with base classes
 * for the interfaces that a sync client must implement to use this
 * implementation. The user-visible API is provided by the SyncManager.
 * Alternatively a sync client can use the more high-level SyncClient
 * class.
 *
 * @todo What does SPDS stand for? DS = Data Synchronization, but SP? Synchronization
 * Protocol? Is this part of the standard or a Funambol acronym? Also mention
 * SPDM.

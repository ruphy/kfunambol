Compiling
=========

To compile the Sync4j C++ Client API on POSIX systems like Linux the
GNU autotools (libtool/autoconf/automake) are used.  All files
necessary to invoke the normal
  configure && make && make install
are provided.

You must have the "curl-config" in your shell search path. You
can get it either by compiling libcurl from source
(http://curl.haxx.se/) or by installing a libcurl development
package for your operating system.

MacOS Notes
===========
To build on MacOS, please set the following env variables before 
issuing the configure command:

export CFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk"
export LDFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk"
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4

Maintainer Notes
================

To modify the build scripts, install the development packages of:
- autoconf
- automake
- libtool

After editing some of the input files (configure.ac, Makefile.am)
the next "make" run will rebuild the build files automatically.

If that somehow doesn't work, the sequence of commands
used to setup the autotools is contained in autogen.sh.

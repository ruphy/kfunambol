    - teo: added CtCap.
           Now we pass to the formatter an ArrayList of CtCap to handle different capabilities.
           In SyncSourceConfig there's a new method called addCtCap to add an element to the 
           ArrayList of CtCap.
           This method has 4 parameters CtType VerCt an arraylist of properties and an int with 
           3 status to handle the FieldLevel param (FLEVEL_DISABLED, FLEVEL_ENABLED, 
           FLEVEL_UNDEFINED)
           CtCype VerCt and FieldLevel are optional. 
           If one of this parameters is not set the method use the default one setted 
           in the configuration. 

getCtCaps returns a reference to the ArrayList of CtCaps 

2008-01-03
    - teo: removed a bug related to the creation and the destruction of the operands arraylist
           in ClauseUtils.cpp.

             unix makefile have been updated accordingly.

2007-11-07
    - toccy: WinTransportAgent - added support for http status codes 402 & 403

             this turned out to confuse many user (unintentional
             space after password, additional carriage-return...)


Funambol SDK C++ 6.5.1

2007-08-03
    - magi:  Added WinContactSif class. It is used to handle the SIF properties
             in a different way. So it is possible to handle also other likes
             Photo.
             Commented code in the Converter class for the b64 binary handling
             Added in Property class the way to set a property without any conversion

             The method size() return a value that is incremented 
             and decremented everytime there's an add or a remove.
             The method add is also improved when there is an add in the last 
             element (a sort of pushback)
             Removed the remove method now there's only the method
             removeElementAt(index) in SyncSourceReport in the
             SyncSourceReport::addItem method was removed a for cycle that
             check if there is a element clone of the one to add. 
             This for cycle is very negative for the performance and useless.

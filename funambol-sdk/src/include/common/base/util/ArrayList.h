/**
 * This class implements a simple linked list that can be accessed by index too.
 * This class does not make use of C++ templates by choice, since it must be
 * as much easier and portable as possible.
 *
 * Each list element must be an instance of ArrayElement, which must be
 * considered an abstract class. Implementing classes must define the destructor
 * and the method clone(), which is used to replicate a given object. This is
 * used by insertion methods: they always clone the item and store the cloned
 * element so that the version inside the list and the caller can independently
 * release their memory. Note that clone methods MUST use the C++ operator to
 * allocate new object, since ArrayList will delete them calling the C++ delete
 * operator.

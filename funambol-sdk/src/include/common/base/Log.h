         *          know about
         * - info: information about a sync session which the user
         *         will want to read during/after each sync session
         * - developer: information about a sync session that is not
         *              interesting for a user (for example, because it
         *              is constant and already known) but which should
         *              be in each log because developers need to know
         *              it. Messages logged with this calls will be included
         *              at LOG_LEVEL_INFO, therefore messages should be small and
         *              not recur so that the log file size remains small.
         * - debug: most detailed logging, messages may be arbitrarily large
         *
         * Here is a decision tree which helps to pick the right level:
         * - an error: => error()
         * - it changes during each sync or marks important steps
         *   in the sync: info()
         * - small, non-recurring message which is important for developers
         *   who read a log produced at LOG_LEVEL_INFO: developer()
         * - everything else: debug()
